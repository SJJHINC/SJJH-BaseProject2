     <br>Parking in CPP is a nightmare !<br>
     
     <br>Have you ever walked back to your car after class, to be followed the entire way by someone hoping to get your spot? <br>
     
     <br>Our solution is simple, a web service that allows students that already have a parked vehicle to advertise their spot and it will allow students to check the ads and pick up the owner of the vehicle in the parking spot that they like and take his parking spot.  <br>
     
    <br> We hope that this web service can make our parking experience in CPP slightly better.<br>
